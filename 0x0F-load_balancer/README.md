A load balancer does exactly what its name suggests – efficiently balances server load. It sits in between the user, or ‘client’, and the server cluster and distributes all the requests from users (like a video, text, application data, or image) across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests, which may be local within the same data center or geographically dispersed across the internet or private networks.
